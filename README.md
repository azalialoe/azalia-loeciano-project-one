This is a repo for Project 1 of Juno College Bootcamp Cohort 36 (Summer 2021)

This multi-pages website is created based on a given design. The design given was for desktop and we had to re-create it and make it responsive.

Languages used in this project: HTML, CSS and SASS. 

I had a lot of help during the making of this project :
- Online sources used the most: Juno College's notes on their GitHub, Mozilla MDN Web Docs, Stack Overflow and css-tricks.com
- My bootcamp instructors: Owen, Adrian, Laura and Safi - their lectures and extra knowledge are very helpful
- Cohort 36 classmates on Discord
- and special thank you to Carlie Dixon from Cohort 34; I learned a lot from her project during her bootcamp
